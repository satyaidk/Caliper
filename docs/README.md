# Documentation

**[Caliper-Technical-Documentation.pdf](Caliper-Technical-Documentation.pdf)** —
84 pages covering the whole application, from `index.html` to the deployed site.

There is also [technical-documentation.html](technical-documentation.html), the
same content as a single self-contained file you can open in a browser. It has
no external dependencies — no fonts, no scripts, no images — so it works offline
and from a `file://` URL.

## What is in it

| Part | Chapters | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I — Orientation | 1–3 | What the app is, every dependency and why, getting it running |
| II — The codebase | 4–12 | Every file explained: boot sequence, store, components, hooks, the 3D engine, loaders, styles |
| III — The ideas | 13–20 | React patterns, Zustand from scratch, three.js from scratch, the measuring maths, routing, performance, TypeScript, accessibility |
| IV — Shipping | 21–26 | Vite, tsconfig, git, GitHub Actions line by line, Vercel, security headers and CSP |
| V — Learning | 27–30 | Ten exercises, mistakes avoided, glossary, further reading |

Plus an appendix with the keyboard reference and a "where to change what" table.

## Regenerating it

The source lives in `src/` as numbered HTML fragments, assembled and rendered by
`build.mjs`. Playwright is not a project dependency — the app does not need it
and this runs perhaps twice a year — so install it when you want to rebuild:

```bash
npm i -D playwright
npx playwright install chromium
node docs/build.mjs
```

That writes both `technical-documentation.html` and the PDF. Remove Playwright
again afterwards if you would rather keep the dependency list clean:

```bash
npm uninstall playwright
```

## Editing it

Edit the fragments in `src/`, not the assembled HTML — that file is generated
and will be overwritten.

| Fragment | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `_head.html` | The `<head>`, and all of the print CSS |
| `01-front.html` | Cover, how to read it, contents, Part I |
| `02-files.html` | Part II |
| `03-concepts.html` | Part III |
| `04-ship.html` | Part IV |
| `05-learn.html` | Part V and the appendix |
| `_tail.html` | Closing tags |

Two conventions worth keeping:

- **Fonts are system-only.** A PDF render that waits on Google Fonts either
  hangs or silently falls back, and neither is acceptable for a document that
  has to build reproducibly.
- **Code samples are hand-highlighted** with `<span class="k">`, `s`, `c`, `n`
  and `t` for keyword, string, comment, number and type. There is no syntax
  highlighter to load, which is what keeps the HTML self-contained. Remember to
  escape `<`, `>` and `&` inside `<pre>` blocks.
